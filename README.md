## Features

### Data Exploration
  - Data exploration is done in 4 notebooks

#### 1.0_preprocessing.ipynb:
  - Here I have cleaned the original data by
    - renaming column labels
    - removing duplicates
    - handle null values
    - convert data types

#### 1.01_outliers.ipynb
  - Here I have calculated outliers in each column and their percentages
  - If the percentage is small i have dropped the rows with outliers
  - For columns with a larger percentage of outliers, I have replaced them with values using the IQR.
 - Then I have selected columns for further analysis and saved them in clean_data.csv. 

#### 1.1_overview:
  - I have done task 1.1 here.

#### 1.2_data_analysis:
  - I have done task 1.2 here.
